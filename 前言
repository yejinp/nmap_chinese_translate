Introduction
介绍

On September 1, 1997, I released a security scanner named Nmap in the fifty-first issue of Phrack magazine.
1997年9月1日，我在杂志《菲里克》（Phrack）的第五十一期上发表了一个名为nmap的安全扫描器。
My goal was to consolidate the fragmented field of special-purpose port scanners into one powerful and flexible free tool, providing a consistent interface and efficient implementation of all practical port scanning techniques.
我的目标是为了整合各种分散的特殊端口扫描器为一个功能强大且灵活的免费工具，在高效的实现所有实用端口扫描技术的同时提供一个统一的接口。
Nmap then consisted of three files (barely 2,000 lines of code) and supported only the Linux operating system.
后来Nmap包含3个文件（仅仅包含约2000行代码），并只支持Linux操作系统。
It was written for my own purposes, and released in the hope that others would find it useful.
编写这个软件完全出于个人目的，抱着别人能够发现它有用的目的而发表。

From these humble beginnings, and through the power of open source development, Nmap grew into the world's most popular network security scanner, with millions of users worldwide.
从卑微开始，通过开源开发的力量，nmap成长为世界上最流行的、有数以万计用户的网络安全扫描器。
Over the years, Nmap has continued to add advanced functionality such as remote OS detection, version/service detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine.
过去几年，nmap添加了诸如远程操作系统检测，版本/服务检测，以及nmap脚本引擎等这些高级功能。
It now supports all major Unix, Windows, and Mac OS platforms with both console and graphical interfaces.
现在，它的控制台和图形界面都支持所有主要UNIX、Windows和Mac操作系统平台，
Publications including Linux Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and the Codetalker Digest have recognized Nmap as “security tool of the year”.
发表在《Linux Journal》、《Info World》、LinuxQuestions.Org和《 Codetalker Digest》等上的文献，让nmap成为了“年度安全工具”。
It was even featured in nine movies, including The Matrix Reloaded, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Die Hard 4.
包括《重装上阵》、《龙纹身的女孩》、《谍影重重》和《虎胆龙威4》等9部电影甚至有nmap的特写镜头。

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing.
Nmap（网络制图者）是一个为网络探索和安全审计的免费开源工具。
Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. 
很多系统和网络管理员也发现用它来处理网络库存、管理服务更新日程安排和监控主机或者服务运行时间等任务也很有用。
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. 
Nmap利用基于原始IP数据包的新方法来判断网络上那些主机可用、主机上提供了那些服务（应用名和版本）、运行的操作系统（操作系统版本）、在使用那些包过滤器或者防火墙和以及其他很多特征。
It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts.
它被设计为快速扫描大型网络，但对单个主机工作得也很好。

While Nmap is extremely powerful, it is also complex.
Nmap功能非常强大，同时也很复杂。
More than 100 command-line options add expressiveness for networking gurus, but can confound novices.
超过100多个命令行选项让网络专家如虎添翼，但困惑新手。
Some of its options have never even been documented.
一些选项甚至都没有描述文档。
This book documents all Nmap features and, more importantly, teaches the most effective ways of using them.
本书描述了所有的Nmap特性，更重要的是，教你最高效的使用方法。
It has taken nearly four years to write, with constant updating as Nmap has evolved.
紧随nmap持续的更新，前后差不多用了4年来写这本书。

This book is dedicated to the Nmap community of users and developers.
敬以本书奉献给nmap社区用户和开发者们。
Your passion, ideas, patches, feature requests, flame wars, bug reports, and midnight rants have shaped Nmap into what it is today.
你的激情、想法、补丁、特性请求、激烈争论、报告bug和午夜牢骚让它成为今天的样子。
                                    —Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon <fyodor@nmap.org>

Intended Audience and Organization
目标读者和组织

This book documents the free Nmap Security Scanner, from port scanning basics for novices to the types of packet crafting used by advanced hackers.
本书从给新手的基本端口扫描到为高级黑客使用的各种包加工技巧描述了免费的安全扫描器nmap。
It should benefit Nmap users (or potential users) of all experience levels.
它可以给Nmap各经验层次的用户（或者说潜在用户）带来益处。

Starting with the basics, this book gives an overview of Nmap by example in Chapter 1.
从基本的开始，本书在第一章通过例子来展示nmap的概貌。
Then Chapter 2 covers obtaining, compiling and installing Nmap.
然后在第二章描述了如何获取、编译和安装nmap。
Chapters 3 through 5 cover features in the order you might use them when conducting a penetration test.
第三章到第五章根据你在渗透测试中可能用到特性的顺序进行介绍。
First comes host discovery (“ping scanning”), which determines the available hosts on a network.
首先是确定一个网络上可用主机的主机发现（ping扫描）功能。
Next, port scanning is covered in depth.
然后全面描述了端口扫描功能。
In Chapter 5, all the Nmap scanning techniques are detailed, with advice and examples.

Scanning a large network can take a long time, so Chapter 6 is full of performance optimization advice.
扫描一个大的网络会耗费很长一段时间，因此第六章全都是性能优化建议。
Chapter 7 details service and application version detection, in which Nmap queries ports to determine exactly what is running rather than simply guessing based on the port number.
在第七章详细描述了服务和应用版本探测功能，这些功能让nmap查询端口以正确地识别而不是基于端口号简单猜测运行着什么服务。
Chapter 8 covers one of Nmap's most loved features: remote OS detection.
第八章描述了大部分Nmap用户最喜欢的特性：操作系统探测。
Chapter 9 details the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), which allows users to write (and share) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks.
在第九章中，详细描述了nmap的脚本引擎（NSE），它允许用户编写（也可分享）一些简单脚本来自动化完成多种多样的网络任务。
My favorite chapter is number 10: Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems.
我最喜欢的是第十章：探测并推翻防火墙和入侵检测系统。
For balance, that is followed by a chapter on defending against Nmap scans.
为了平衡，紧接着的一章就是如何防御nmap扫描。
Chapter 12 then fully documents the Zenmap multi-platform Nmap GUI and results viewer.
第十二章完整描述了zenmap多平台nmap图形用户界面和结果视图。
The next two chapters cover output formats and data files.
下面的两章描述了输出格式和数据文件。
The final four chapters are reference guides for the whole family of tools: Nmap, Ndiff, Ncat, and Nping.
最后四章分别为Nmap、Ndiff、Ncat和Nping的用户指南。
These are quick resources for looking up specific command-line options or brief feature summaries.
这些章节提供了一种快速查询特定命令行选项或者特征简述。

Scattered throughout the book are detailed instructions for performing common tasks such as scanning a network for a certain single open TCP port or detecting wireless access points by scanning from the wired side.
书中随处可见完成常见任务的详细指令，如扫描一个网络中一个特定开放端口或者通过有线来探测无线接入点。
First each problem is described, then an effective solution is provided.
首先描述了每个问题，然后提供了高效的解决方法。
A final discussion section describes the solution in more depth and may provide alternative solutions and insights into similar problems.
最后更深层次讨论描述了解决方法并提供了可选解决方法和类似问题的深刻见解。

Technology Used to Create This Book
创作本书用到的技术

As an author of open source tools myself, I'm a big believer in their power and capability.
身为开源工具作者，我对他们的能力坚信不疑。

So I made an effort to use them wherever possible in creating this book.
所以我尝试让任何地方利用他们来创作本书。

I wasn't about to write it in Microsoft Word and then handle layout with Adobe FrameMaker!
我可不会用先用Microsoft Word编辑然后再用Adobe framemaker来处理布局。

Nmap Network Scanning was written with the GNU Emacs text editor in the DocBook XML format.
nmap网络扫描用gnu emacs文本编辑器用docbookxml格式编写。
The free online chapters are created from the XML using Norman Walsh's XSL Stylesheets and the xsltproc XSL processor.
在线免费章有xml

The print version also uses Norman's stylesheets and xsltproc, but output to the XSL-FO format.
打印版同样使用和，但输出为XSL-FO格式。

An XSL-FO processor is then used to build a PDF.
XSL-FO后来用于创建PDF文档。

Subversion was used for revision control and the free web chapters are serviced by Apache httpd.
我们用Subversion来控制版本，免费的章节由apache httd给大家提供服务。

TCP/IP参考
TCP/IP Reference

This book assumes basic familiarity with TCP/IP and networking concepts.
本书假设你对TCP/IP和网络概念基本熟悉。

You won't find a primer on the OSI seven-layer model or a rundown of the Berkeley Socket API within these pages.
本书不会给出OSI七层模型或者Berkeley Socket API纲要。

For a comprehensive guide to TCP/IP, I recommend “The TCP/IP Guide” by Charles Kozierok or the old classic “TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume I” by W. Richard Stevens.
如果要对TCP/IP进行深入了解，建议参考Charles Kozierok的《The TCP/IP Guide》或者W. Richard Stevens写的经典的《TCP/IP Illustrated》（卷1）。
While TCP/IP familiarity is expected, even the best of us occasionally forget byte offsets for packet header fields and flags.

This section provides quick reference diagrams and field descriptions for the IPv4, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols.
本节提供了IPv4、TCP、UDP和ICMP等协议的快速参考图和各域的描述。

These beautiful diagrams from http://www.visi.com/~mjb/Drawings are used by permission of author Matt Baxter.

Introduction
介绍

On September 1, 1997, I released a security scanner named Nmap in the fifty-first issue of Phrack magazine. 
1997年9月1日，我在杂志《Phrack》的第五十五期上发布了一个名为nmap的安全扫描工具。
My goal was to consolidate the fragmented field of special-purpose port scanners into one powerful and flexible free tool, providing a consistent interface and efficient implementation of all practical port scanning techniques. 
我的目标是为了加强分散的各种特殊端口扫描器为一个功能强大且灵活的免费工具，提供一个一致的接口，高效的实现各种实用端口扫描技术。
Nmap then consisted of three files (barely 2,000 lines of code) and supported only the Linux operating system. 
Nmap后来包含3个文件（仅仅包含约2000行代码）并只支持Linux操作系统。
It was written for my own purposes, and released in the hope that others would find it useful.
写这个软件完全出于个人的目的，抱着别人能够发现它有用。

From these humble beginnings, and through the power of open source development, Nmap grew into the world's most popular network security scanner, with millions of users worldwide. 
从简陋开始，通过开源开发的力量，nmap成为了世界上最流行的网络安全扫描器，在世界范围内，有数以万计的用户。
Over the years, Nmap has continued to add advanced functionality such as remote OS detection, version/service detection, and the Nmap Scripting Engine. 
过去几年，nmap添加了远程操作系统检测和版本/服务检测，以及nmap脚本引擎这些高级功能。 
It now supports all major Unix, Windows, and Mac OS platforms with both console and graphical interfaces. 
Publications including Linux Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and the Codetalker Digest have recognized Nmap as “security tool of the year”. 
发表在《Linux Journal》、《Info World》、LinuxQuestions.Org和《 Codetalker Digest》等上的文献，让nmap成为了“安全工具年”。
It was even featured in nine movies, including The Matrix Reloaded, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Die Hard 4.
 它甚至在9部电影中出现，包括《》、《》、《》、《》。
 
 Nmap（）是一个为网络探究和安全审计的免费开源工具。

While Nmap is extremely powerful, it is also complex. 
Nmap功能非常强大，同时也很复杂。
More than 100 command-line options add expressiveness for networking gurus, but can confound novices. 
有超过100多个命令行选项网络专家得心应手，但困惑新手。
Some of its options have never even been documented. 
一些选项甚至都没有描述文档。
This book documents all Nmap features and, more importantly, teaches the most effective ways of using them. 
本书描述了所有的Nmap特性，更重要的是，教你最高效的使用方法。
It has taken nearly four years to write, with constant updating as Nmap has evolved.
随着nmap持续的更新，差不多用了4年来写这本书。

很多系统和网络管理员也发现用它来处理网络库存、管理服务更新日程安排和监控主机或者服务运行时间等任务。Nmap 用一种新的方法利用原始IP数据包来判断网络上那些主机可用，在使用那些包过滤器和防火墙，以及其他特征。它被设计为快速扫描大型网络，但对单个主机工作得也很好。

This book is dedicated to the Nmap community of users and developers. 
这本书奉献给nmap社区用户和开发者。
Your passion, ideas, patches, feature requests, flame wars, bug reports, and midnight rants have shaped Nmap into what it is today.
你的激情、想法、补丁、特性请求、战火、报告bug和午夜牢骚让它成为今天的样子。
                              —Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon <fyodor@nmap.org>

目标读者和组织

这本书描述了免费的安全扫描软件nmap，从给新手的基本端口扫描到为高级黑客使用的各种包的精巧加工。它可以给Nmap各层次的用户（或者说潜在用户）带来益处。
从基本的开始，本书在第一章通过例子来展示nmap的概貌。然后在第二章描述了获取、编译和安装nmap。第三章到第五章用你在渗透测试用可能用到的顺序特性。首先是主机发现（ping扫描），确定一个网络上的可用主机。然后是纵深描述端口扫描。在第五章中，所有的nmap扫描技术都有详细描述，包括建议和例子。扫描一个大的网络会耗费一些时间，因此第六章都是性能优化建议。在第七章详细描述了服务和应用版本探测功能，这些功能让nmap查询端口以基于端口正确地识别而不是简单猜测运行着什么服务。第八章描述了Nmap最喜欢的特性：操作系统探测。在第九章中，详细描述了nmap的脚本引擎（nse），它允许用户写（分享）一些简单脚本来自动化完成不同的网络任务。我最喜欢的是第十章：探测和推翻防火墙和入侵检测系统。为了达到平衡，紧接着的一章就是如何防御nmap扫描。第十二章完整描述了zenmap的多平台nmap gui和结果视图。下面的两章描述了输出格式和数据文件。最后的四章分别为Nmap、Ndiff、Ncat和Nping的用户指南。这些章节提供了一种快速查询特定命令行选项或者特征简述。
分布在书中完成通常任务，如扫描一个网络中的特定一个开放端口或者通过有线来探测无线接入点的详细指令。首先描述了每个问题，然后提供了高效的解决问题方法。最后更深层次讨论描述了解决方法并提供了可选解决方法和类似问题的深刻见解。

Request for Comments 
评论请求
While I tried my best to make this book comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date, we all make mistakes. 
If you find any problems or just have suggestions for making this book better, please let me know by email at <fyodor@nmap.org>. 
The open source principle of many readers and contributors is just as viable for documentation as for software. 
As the next section attests, dozens of people have already generously contributed their time and skills to make this book a success.

If you have a question or comment about Nmap (rather than this book itself), it is best sent to the Nmap development list as described at the section called “Bugs”.

Acknowledgements
致谢
When I first floated the idea of writing an Nmap book to the nmap-hackers mailing list, I was inundated with suggestions and offers to help. 
This outpouring of enthusiasm convinced me to proceed. 
My complete naivety about how much work was involved also contributed to my decision. 
It has been quite an undertaking, but what kept me going chapter by chapter was a private review group called the nmap-writers. 
They provided invaluable feedback, advice, and detailed review notes throughout the process. 
In particular, I would like to thank the following people:

David Fifield is listed first (everyone else is alphabetical) because he was a tremendous help during the book writing process. 
He solved a number of technical DocBook problems, created many of the final illustrations from my terrible drafts, dramatically improved the index, helped with proofreading, and even wrote Chapter 12, Zenmap GUI Users' Guide.

Matt Baxter allowed the use of his beautiful TCP/IP header diagrams (in the section called “TCP/IP Reference”). 
Several other diagrams in this book were done in that style to match.

Saurabh Bhasin contributed detailed feedback on a regular basis.

Mark Brewis could always be counted on for good advice.

Ellen Colombo was a big help from the beginning.

Patrick Donnelly helped improve Chapter 9, Nmap Scripting Engine.

Brandon Enright printed out the whole book and reviewed it chapter by chapter.

Brian Hatch has always been a big help.

Loren Heal was a continual source of ideas.

Lee “MadHat” Heath wrote the section called “MadHat in Wonderland” and also an early version of the section called “Grepable Output (-oG)”.

Dan Henage provided advice and proofread numerous chapters.

Tor Houghton reviewed every chapter, probably giving me more feedback than anyone else.

Doug Hoyte documented the many Nmap features he added, and also handled most of the book indexing.

Marius Huse Jacobsen reviewed many chapters, providing detailed feedback.

Kris Katterjohn performed thorough reviews of several chapters.

Eric Krosnes sent useful technical review feedback and also regularly nagged me about book progress. 
This was helpful since I didn't have a traditional editor to do so.

Vlad Alexa Mancini created the Nmap eye logo for the cover (and the Nmap web site).

Michael Naef kindly reviewed many chapters.

Bill Pollock of No Starch Press was always happy to provide advice and answer book publishing questions based on his decades of experience.

David Pybus was one of the most frequent contributors of ideas and proofreading.

Tyler Reguly helped by reviewing multiple chapters just when it was most needed.

Chuck Sterling provided both high level advice and detailed proofreading of several chapters.

Anders Thulin provided detailed reviews of many chapters.

Bennett Todd sent dozens of suggestions.

Diman Todorov wrote an initial draft of Chapter 9, Nmap Scripting Engine.

Catherine Tornabene read many chapters and sent extremely detailed feedback.

Technology Used to Create This Book

As an author of open source tools myself, I'm a big believer in their power and capability. 
So I made an effort to use them wherever possible in creating this book. 
I wasn't about to write it in Microsoft Word and then handle layout with Adobe FrameMaker!

Nmap Network Scanning was written with the GNU Emacs text editor in the DocBook XML format.

The free online chapters are created from the XML using Norman Walsh's XSL Stylesheets and the xsltproc XSL processor.

The print version also uses Norman's stylesheets and xsltproc, but output to the XSL-FO format. 
An XSL-FO processor is then used to build a PDF. 
I would like to use Apache FOP for this, but a footnote-related bug prevents this, so I switched to the RenderX XEP Engine. 
XEP is proprietary, but at least it runs on Linux. 
I hope to switch back to FOP after the footnote bug is fixed.

Cover layout was done with Scribus and (due to printing company format requirements) Adobe InDesign. 
Raster graphics for the cover and internal illustrations were created with The Gimp, while Inkscape was used for vector graphics.

Subversion was used for revision control and the free web chapters are serviced by Apache httpd.


TCP/IP参考
TCP/IP Reference

This book assumes basic familiarity with TCP/IP and networking concepts. 
本书加上你对TCP/IP 和网络概念有基本的了解。

You won't find a primer on the OSI seven-layer model or a rundown of the Berkeley Socket API within these pages. 

For a comprehensive guide to TCP/IP, I recommend “The TCP/IP Guide” by Charles Kozierok or the old classic “TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume I” by W. Richard Stevens.
如果要对TCP/IP进行深入了解，建议参考Charles Kozierok的《The TCP/IP Guide》或者W. Richard Stevens写的经典的《TCP/IP Illustrated》（卷1）。
While TCP/IP familiarity is expected, even the best of us occasionally forget byte offsets for packet header fields and flags.

This section provides quick reference diagrams and field descriptions for the IPv4, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols. 
本节提供了IPv4、TCP、UDP和ICMP协议各域的快速参考图。
